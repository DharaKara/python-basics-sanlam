## Lookbehind Assertions in Regular Expressions 

Lookbehind assertions are a feature of regular expressions (also known as regex or regexp) which is used to check if a certain pattern precedes the current matching point in the string being processed. In Python's regular expression syntax, lookbehind assertions are denoted by `(?<=...)` for positive lookbehind and `(?<!...)` for negative lookbehind.

| Assertion Type      | Syntax      | Description         | Example        |
|---------------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Positive Lookbehind | `(?<=...)`  | Asserts that a specific pattern immediately precedes the current position in the string. Does not consume any characters in the string. | `(?<=abc)`     |
| Negative Lookbehind | `(?<!...)`  | Asserts that a specific pattern does not immediately precede the current position in the string. Similar to positive lookbehind, it does not consume characters. | `(?<!abc)`     |

Lookbehind assertions can be useful for extracting specific parts of a string that are preceded by certain patterns without including those patterns in the match. Nonetheless, one should note that not all regex engines support variable-length lookbehind assertions. Python's `re` module does support variable-length lookbehind.
