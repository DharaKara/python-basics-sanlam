In Python, currying and partial application are both techniques used for function transformation or manipulation. While they are related concepts, they serve slightly different purposes.

1. **Currying**:

Currying is a process in functional programming where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows you to partially apply the function by fixing some of its arguments and obtaining a new function with fewer arguments.

Example of **currying** in Python:

```python
def add(x):
    def add_inner(y):
        return x + y
    return add_inner

# Usage
add_5 = add(5)
print(add_5(3))  # Output: 8
```

Above we see that the `add` function is curried. When you call `add(5)`, it returns a new function `add_inner` that takes one argument `y` and adds it to the original argument `x`.

2. **Partial Application**:

Partial application is a broader concept than currying. It involves fixing a certain number of arguments of a function and creating a new function with fewer parameters, while still retaining the ability to provide the remaining arguments later.

In Python, the `functools` module provides a function called `partial` for partial application:

```python
from functools import partial

def power(x, y):
    return x ** y

# Partially applying power function to create a new function
square = partial(power, y=2)

# Usage
print(square(3))  # Output: 9
```

In the above code, `partial(power, y=2)` creates a new function `square` which is equivalent to `power` with `y` fixed at `2`.

**Key Differences**:

- Currying is specifically about transforming functions that take multiple arguments into a series of functions each taking a single argument.
- Partial application is a more general concept where you fix a certain number of arguments of a function, obtaining a new function with fewer parameters.
